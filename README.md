# Echo
A Firefox extension that can parse [Narcissuus](https://github.com/mozilla/narcissus). Echo is a nymph cursed to only repeat the words spoken to her, embodying unrequited love and the loss of her own voice.

Narcissus is an interpreter written in JavaScript for JavaScript. It is a good engine for experimenting with JavaScript’s design; however, it does not integrate easily into the browser. This project introduces "Echo", a browser add-on designed to execute Narcissus JavaScript files and scripts within web browsers. The project also explores the performance of the Narcissus interpreter against native browser JavaScript engines and benchmarks the results, showcasing the trade-offs in running an experimental engine—the Narcissus interpreter—on the browser versus native JavaScript. Additionally, as a proof of concept, we implement taint tracking, a capability meant to boost security by preventing sensitive data from being corrupted. This builds on prior uses of Narcissus for security and language feature prototyping.
